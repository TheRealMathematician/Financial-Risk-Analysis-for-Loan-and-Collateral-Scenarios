### **📘 Background and Overview**

This project presents a deep-dive analysis into **collateral risks**, 📉 **volatility**, and 🔗 **correlation challenges** across six diverse lending scenarios. Each case represents a different financial structure and risk profile:

1. 🎓 **Student Loans** – Unsecured, fixed-rate lending
2. 🚗 **Vehicle Loans** – Secured, floating-rate lending
3. 🏗️ **Construction Loans** – Business-purpose, fixed-rate lending
4. 📈 **Securities Lending** – Backed by publicly traded equities
5. 💵 **Publicly Traded Bonds** – Specifically 1-year U.S. Treasury securities
6. 🇮🇳 **Illiquid Securities** – Represented by the India Nifty 50 ETF

### **🧠 Analytical Workflow**

Our structured approach follows these key steps:

* **🔍 Step 1: Identify Risks**
  Evaluate the collateral and financing risks unique to each lending type.

* **📊 Step 2: Quantify Statistical Challenges**
  Analyze volatility and correlation dynamics to understand systemic exposures.

* **🛠️ Steps 3–6: Data Analysis & Insight Generation**

  * 🧬 **Data Sourcing** – Collect reliable market and asset-specific data
  * 🧮 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncover trends, outliers, and risk signals
  * 💡 **Insights & Recommendations** – Propose risk mitigation strategies for better lending decisions

🔐 **Goal**: Strengthen financial decision-making by unpacking the statistical complexity and risk nuances across varied lending environments.

## 📊 Data Structure Overview

The dataset is **scenario-specific**, integrating diverse financial, academic, and credit data. Sources include **financial APIs** (e.g., WSJ, Yahoo Finance), **government/academic portals**, and **credit bureaus**.

Each scenario is mapped to a distinct data pipeline with tailored frequency and preprocessing techniques. Below is a summary of the metadata:

| 🏦 **Scenario**              | 📁 **Data Type**                      | 🌐 **Source**                  | ⏱️ **Frequency** | 🛠️ **Processing**         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🏗️ Construction Loan        | Treasury bond coupon rates            | WSJ                            | Daily            | Adjusted data              |
| 📈 Securities Lending        | ETF prices (e.g., UltraPro Short QQQ) | WSJ                            | Daily            | Raw traded data            |
| 💵 US Treasury Bonds         | Bond yields                           | Yahoo Finance / Robinhood      | Daily            | Adjusted data              |
| 🇮🇳 Illiquid Security (ETF) | ETF adjusted close prices             | Yahoo Finance                  | Daily            | Adjusted data              |
| 🎓 Student Loans             | Academic results, employment status   | Govt. portals (e.g., Stats SA) | Ad-hoc           | Modeled / validated        |
| 🚗 Vehicle Loans             | Credit scores, asset values           | Experian, DebtCheck            | Ad-hoc           | Market-comparison analysis |

## 🧾 Executive Summary

This data framework supports rigorous, scenario-driven analysis by ensuring:

* ✅ Accurate and reliable data ingestion
* 🔄 Dynamic frequency handling (daily vs ad-hoc)
* 🧪 Customized preprocessing (e.g., adjustment, modeling)
* 🔍 Traceability to credible, domain-specific sources

📌 These structured inputs are critical for downstream tasks such as **risk modeling**, **volatility tracking**, and **correlation analysis**.
